Web Based Training Sample

This web-based training module is a sample of the work I have done in the past. This example is a required training for all Remote Pilot Aircraft (RPA) Handlers at Drone Delivery Canada.
The training was built using Articulate Rise 360 and we hosted it on our LMS - Master Control.
